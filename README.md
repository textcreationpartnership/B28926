THE Queries and Protestation OF THE Scots Episcopal Clergy AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF THE Presbyterian
1. The PREFACE.

#####Body#####

1. Names of the DELEGATS commissionat by the General Meeting at Aberdeen upon the 5th Day of June 1694. for presenting the Queries, &c. to the Committee at Aberdeen, are as follows:

    _ Query I. WHereas, according to the Principles of Presbyterian Government, there ought be no higher Degree of Pastors in the Church than Presbyters, and all Presbyters are equal in Power and Authority, we desire to know by what Divine and Ecclesiastick Right these fifty or sixty surviving Presbyterian Ministers, not being in actual Charge within this Kingdom, did take upon them the Exercise of the whole Ecclesiastick Power of this
National Church, and have exerced a more full and absolute Authority and Jurisdiction over their Brethren, nine hundred or a thousand Ministers, who were in Office when Episcopacy was abolished, than ever the Bishops pretended to, who never claimed a Power to make Acts concerning the Church, without Consent of its Ministers.

    _ Query II. Since according to their own Principles, the Power of preaching the Gospel, and administring the Sacraments, and the Power of Discipline and Government are inseparable in the Office of a Pastor; Quaeritur, If that Constitution of Church-Government be lawful, which excludes the greatest part of the Pastors of the Church from having any share in the Government thereof?

    _ Query III. SEeing no Assembly of Church-Officers can justly claim any Authority or Jurisdiction over a Church, wherein that Church is not duly represented; and a Church cannot be represented in an Assembly in which their Delegats are not allowed to sit: And that by the Constitution of this Church, a General Assembly doth consist of Commissioners from all the Presbytries within the Kingdom. Quaeritur, How the late Presbyterian Assemblies can be owned for lawful General Assemblies of this Church, since they consisted intirely of the Presbyterian Party; and the Presbytries of this Diocess, and several others within this Kingdom had no Commissioners present at these Assemblies, nor had they a Call to send any?

    _ Query IV. SInce by the Principles already mentioned, all Pastors have an equal Right to share in the Government of that Church whereof they are Members and Office-bearers: And since the whole Body of the Pastors of this Church, who were in Office at the time of the Abolishment of Episcopacy, cannot be charged with Ignorance, gross Error, Immorality of Life, or supine Negligence in their Office; We cannot understand how the Constitution of the present Church-Government, and late Assemblies, can be justified by the Presbyterian Ministers but upon this Supposition, that the whole Body of Pastors foresaid, are either no Ministers of the Gospel, or such corrupt ones upon the account of their Principles and Practice, in relation to Church-Government, as that they are not worthy to be trusted with the Exercise of that Power which belongs to the Pastoral Office: which we cannot own without either renouncing our Ministrie, and declaring all the Acts of our Ministerial Function null and void.

    _ Query V. Quaeritur, Whether the annual Office of Ruling (not Preaching) Elders, chosen out among the People, and joined with Ministers in Kirk-Sessions, Presbyteries, Provincial and General Assemblies, and their Committees, to assist and concur with them in the Exercise of Discipline and Government, can be warrantably affirmed to be of Divine Institution? And if any Footstep of such an Office doth appear in the Practice of the antient Church; or any plain convincing Proof of its Institution can be produced out of the Scriptures: And if this Office be not of Divine Institution, whether a Judicatory consisting in part of such Officers pretending to Divine Institution, and to act by Warrant and Commission from Jesus Christ, be a lawful Judicatory?

    _ A List of those whose Pastoral Relation to the respective Churches following, was declared null, they discharged to preach any more in them, because they had no Title or Right, but what a Call without the Interposition of the Authority of any Church-Judicatorie gave them; viz.

1. At the King's College-Kirk of Aberdeen, the 5th of June 1694.

    _ Query IV. SInce by the Principles already mentioned, all Pastors have an equal Right to share in the Government of that Church whereof they are Members and Office-bearers: And since the whole Body of the Pastors of this Church, who were in Office at the time of the Abolishment of Episcopacy, cannot be charged with Ignorance, gross Error, Immorality of Life, or supine Negligence in their Office; We cannot understand how the Constitution of the present Church-Government, and late Assemblies, can be justified by the Presbyterian Ministers but upon this Supposition, that the whole Body of Pastors foresaid, are either no Ministers of the Gospel, or such corrupt ones upon the account of their Principles and Practice, in relation to Church-Government, as that they are not worthy to be trusted with the Exercise of that Power which belongs to the Pastoral Office: which we cannot own without either renouncing our Ministrie, and declaring all the Acts of our Ministerial Function null and void.
